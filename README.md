# Bevy Salva
An unofficial crate for integrating the [Salva](https://github.com/dimforge/salva) fluid dynamics crate with the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine, including coupling with the [Rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier) mechanical physics engine.
I'm trying to keep the codebase structure as similar to the bevy_rapier codebase as possible for consistency (and also because I don't really know the best way to structure this crate).
