# Bevy Salva
A crate for integrating the [Salva](https://github.com/dimforge/salva) fluid dynamics crate into the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine, including coupling with the [Rapier](https://github.com/dimforge/rapier) mechanical physics engine.  
As of right now, I am only making a 3D crate, but I might make a 2D crate some day as well.
